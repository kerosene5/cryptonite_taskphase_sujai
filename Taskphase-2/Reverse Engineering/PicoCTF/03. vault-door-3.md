# vault-door-3
__Flag:__`picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_1fb380}`

## Description
> This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here:
```java
import java.util.*;

class VaultDoor3 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        VaultDoor3 vaultDoor = new VaultDoor3();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter vault password: ");
        String userInput = scanner.next();
	String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(),userInput.length()-1);
	if (vaultDoor.checkPassword(input)) {
	    System.out.println("Access granted.");
	} else {
	    System.out.println("Access denied!");
        }
    }

    // Our security monitoring team has noticed some intrusions on some of the
    // less secure doors. Dr. Evil has asked me specifically to build a stronger
    // vault door to protect his Doomsday plans. I just *know* this door will
    // keep all of those nosy agents out of our business. Mwa ha!
    //

    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        if (password.length() != 32) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[32];
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        for (; i<16; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
        }
        for (; i<32; i+=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
        }
        for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        String s = new String(buffer);
        return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340");
    }
}

## Solution 
This was slightly harder than the previous one, as you can see by the notation `3`. I do not know why there is no 'vault-door-2' though, I thought I skipped that.

Anyway, so when we open the source code for this challenge, you will see that they have used `for` loops to hide the password.

If you examine the code, you will realize that:
* The first 8 characters of `buffer` match the first 8 characters of `password`.
* The next 8 characters (8-15) of `password` are reversed and placed in `buffer`.
* For even indices from 16 to 30: `buffer[i] = password.charAt(46 - i);`
* For odd indices from 31 down to 17: `buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);`

So, I made a simple script to reverse engineer the password and get the flag:
```java
public class VaultDoor3Solver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] target = "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340".toCharArray();
        char[] password = new char[32];

        // Reverse engineer the password based on the buffer logic in checkPassword
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            password[i] = target[i];
        }
        for (; i < 16; i++) {
            password[23 - i] = target[i];
        }
        for (i = 16; i < 32; i += 2) {
            password[46 - i] = target[i];
        }
        for (i = 31; i >= 17; i -= 2) {
            password[i] = target[i];
        }

        System.out.println("picoCTF{" + new String(password) + "}");
    }
}
```
