__Flag:__`picoCTF{perhaps_the_dog_jumped_over_was_just_tired}`

## Description
> I found the flag, but my brother wrote a program to encrypt all his text files. He has a spelling quiz study guide too, but I don't know if that helps.

## Solution 
A pretty nice challenge. So they provide you with a `.zip` file containing:
* encrypt.py
```python
import random
import os

files = [
    os.path.join(path, file)
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk('.')
    for file in files
    if file.split('.')[-1] == 'txt'
]

alphabet = list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
random.shuffle(shuffled := alphabet[:])
dictionary = dict(zip(alphabet, shuffled))

for filename in files:
    text = open(filename, 'r').read()
    encrypted = ''.join([
        dictionary[c]
        if c in dictionary else c
        for c in text
    ])
    open(filename, 'w').write(encrypted)
```
* study-guide.txt (The file is too long so i only put a bit here)
```

```
* flag.txt

`brcfxba_vfr_mid_hosbrm_iprc_exa_hoav_vwcrm`

So to solve this, I just typed `cipher decoder` and went to [boxentriq.com](boxentriq.com).

Using the cipher identifier, I got to know that this is a substitution cipher, then I just pasted the the `study-guide.txt` along with `flag.txt` in the decoder and found the flag.
