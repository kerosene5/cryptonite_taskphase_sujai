# Day 1

So this was the introduction to the CCNA as a whole and how the whole course is structured.

There was a guide regarding how to install _Packet Tracer_, which is what will be used for all the labs here.

I also downloaded the flashcard software _Anki_, as there have been flashcards provided for this course. These will be very useful in remembering everything so make sure you do that.

Basic terminologies were explained such as the Client, Server, Switches and Routers.

The concept of end-host and everything that comes in between to enable communication is the main focuse here. I learnt about what switches are, how they work and what they look like here.

The same goes for Routers and Firewalls.
