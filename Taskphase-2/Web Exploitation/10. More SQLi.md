__Solution__: Okay, so this challenge is a SQL injection challenge. First we see this:

So here, we put something random for the username and password and we get this after pressing Log In:

So as you can see, the password field comes first, that means the username field in this case is useless. Also, they have not sanitized their inputs from the look of this query so that is a good sign.

Now, if we put `' OR 1=1--` where `'` means the parameter ends (blank), and then `OR 1=1` is a statement which will always be `TRUE`. So the system will evaluate that field as True regardless of what input there may be.

We need to make sure that the "password" parameter results in true, even if its never matching a valid password.
Thats where the "or 1=1" part of the payload comes in. We are basically saying to the server "Ok, find me a password that is empty (Due to us closing the single quote) OR does 1=1?"

And because theres no password that is blank, it checks our OR statement and sees that 1 does in fact equal 1. So it sets the password check to TRUE.

And then we put `--` which means everything after `--` is a comment, so in this case the username field will become a comment, and its useless now.
Usually we do this kind of stuff in the Username field, but here the password field is evaluated first. 

Pressing Log In gives us:

If you open this thing in BurpSuite, the request sent after pressing the Log In button will receive a response which redirects you to the above page.

If you examine that response you will see this:
