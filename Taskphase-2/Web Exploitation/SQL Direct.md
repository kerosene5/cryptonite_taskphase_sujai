# SQL Direct
__Flag__:`picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_21c94904}`

__Solution__: Here, we get our first experience with SQL. For this challenge, we need to connect to a PostgreSQL server and find the flag.
Using the command `psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 60745 -U postgres pico` to connect to the database, we see this:
```
kerosene-picoctf@webshell:~$ psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 58949 -U postgres pico
Password for user postgres: 
psql (14.13 (Ubuntu 14.13-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 15.2 (Debian 15.2-1.pgdg110+1))
WARNING: psql major version 14, server major version 15.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.
```
Since this is a database, the flag is likely hidden in some table, so we use `\dt` for PostgreSQL to view all the tables which gives us:
```
pico=# \dt
         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner   
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)
```

Now, we need to view the contents of the `flags` table. So, we do that using the command `SELECT * FROM flags;`. 
Here, `*` is used to select all the columns (like file globbing) and display them.

## Some Assembly Required 1
__Flag__:`picoCTF{d88090e679c48f3945fcaa6a7d6d70c5}`

__Solution__: Go to the website and inspect the source code. Using the`Debugger`, you will see that in a WASM (WebAssembly) file, the flag has been provided:
