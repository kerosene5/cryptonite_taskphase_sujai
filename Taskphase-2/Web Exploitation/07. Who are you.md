## Solution
This is a pretty fun challenge focusing on headers within a request. When you first visit the site you get this

`I don't trust users visiting from another site.`

So we add a Referer Header in the request which is same as the host site
Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:39114/. Then we get this:

```
Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
```

Then we add the Date Header in the request with value of `2018`

```
I don&#39;t trust users who can be tracked.
```

And now you add a DNT Header with value `1`.

```
This website is only for people from Sweden.
```

Now, you add the header IP Address X-Forwarded-For: 102.177.146.0 to make the request look like its from Sweden.

```
You&#39;re in Sweden but you don&#39;t speak Swedish?
```

Finally we edit the language header to `sv-SE,sv;q=0.9` to change the language to Swedish

And so, we get the response:
`What can I say except, you are welcome` 
and then we get the flag.
