# SOAP
__Flag:__`picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_0e13660d}`

## Description
> The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?

## Solution
Finally, Web Exploitation has been completed.

This challenge initially did not work for me, I could not solve it no matter what I tried. I made sure that what I tried was infact correct, however no succcess.

But, we have done it. I have only one thing to say: __Fuck iBus Wifi__

Anyway, on to the challenge.

So, here we are introduced to XML (Xtensible Markup Language), which was used to store and move data cross-platform and on any software. How do we know that XML will be our main focus?

Well, the name of the challenge 'SOAP' refers to a protocol that is used for exchanging information in `XML`. So, reading up on XML gives us our point of attack: XXE injections (XML External Entity Injections).

Simply put, an XXE injection uses a vulnerability (allowing external entities to be referenced) in the XML file to view inaccessible data. This is exactly what we will be doing.

For this challenge, I used Postman as it was the fastest method. Howver you can use BurpSuite or cURL to solve it as well. I basically added an `ENTITY` that referenced the `etc/passwd` file.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>
  <ID>&file;</ID>
</data>
```
The vulnerability here is that, we are not allowed to see it. So the response will be `Invalid ID` along with the item referenced. 

The thing here is that `etc/passwd` being referenced will also include the contents of the file and thus, our flag.
