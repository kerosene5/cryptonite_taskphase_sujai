## Solution
Okay, so in this challenge, the site is displayed as:

<img width="241" alt="{B6E572AE-F54A-4B20-8982-FB688E05CCFA}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11afb775-bc22-43e9-9e1c-61ba5ec18306">

Since the name of the challenge mentions robots specifically, webcrawlers come to mind especially.
Websites usually have a page called `robots.txt` meant specifically for bots to visit first when crawling the web. This is done specifically to avoid overloading the website with requests.
Anyway, appending `robots.txt` to the url gives us:

<img width="190" alt="{01C36F1F-9F4B-4F69-999E-B2B14C031C80}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97be05f2-0f27-473d-81f9-d0bd47799ce3">

Disallow means the bot is not allowed to visit that URL, but we can, so setting the User Agent as `*` and going to the URL `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html` gives us:
