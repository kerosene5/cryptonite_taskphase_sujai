# Challenges
## Inspect HTML
__Flag__:`picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}`

__Solution__: Just use the `Inspect Element` option in your browser and find the flag in the `html` code of the website. Easy-peasy.

## IntroToBurp
__Flag__:`picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_3e3ddc76}`
__Solution__: This challenge is meant as an introduction to BurpSuite, an application that acts as a proxy between your browser and the sites you visit, essentially allowing you to read, write and modify the traffic sent in between. So here we get this site:

After filling in random details and pressing register, we get this:

Now, since we obviously dont have any OTP, we just put some nonsense and then get this:

So, we need to find the OTP somehow, but how? ... What if we could bypass the OTP?
Using BurpSuite, we take a look at the request sent to the site during 2FA authentication:

As you can see, at the end we got the `otp` field, i put `bruh` in it and submitted it. But what if i removed it entirely? deleting the `otp` entirely:

After forwarding this request, we get the result:
