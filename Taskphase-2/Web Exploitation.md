All of these picoGym challenges fall under the domain of Web Exploitation. 
# Challenges
## Inspect HTML
__Flag__:`picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}`

__Solution__: Just use the `Inspect Element` option in your browser and find the flag in the `html` code of the website. Easy-peasy.

## IntroToBurp
__Flag__:`picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_3e3ddc76}`
__Solution__: This challenge is meant as an introduction to BurpSuite, an application that acts as a proxy between your browser and the sites you visit, essentially allowing you to read, write and modify the traffic sent in between. So here we get this site:

<img width="263" alt="{4DD1F7FB-F3C8-4CE9-A65F-CA880FAA55C7}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7365b953-efd1-4124-a814-6196806777d8">

After filling in random details and pressing register, we get this:

<img width="230" alt="{06598A44-E6EC-4FDF-8643-E96A8D1F929E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96f7e496-8db6-472b-8714-723f7ffc4566">

Now, since we obviously dont have any OTP, we just put some nonsense and then get this:

<img width="112" alt="{E2E12D68-C7F6-48E5-AC87-143FD880C5F6}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e298f79f-a42b-4cf2-a585-9fd6be5d344f">

So, we need to find the OTP somehow, but how? ... What if we could bypass the OTP?
Using BurpSuite, we take a look at the request sent to the site during 2FA authentication:

<img width="378" alt="{742BB6D0-B25F-44DA-8B1A-F11E67BDB113}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49326529-da1a-4415-8627-9768bbd716ac">

As you can see, at the end we got the `otp` field, i put `bruh` in it and submitted it. But what if i removed it entirely? deleting the `otp` entirely:

<img width="387" alt="{E3F55905-B1AB-4AB3-A760-00F0588126D6}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b212a7a-4aa5-4c00-8f86-fc4cb2687f44">

After forwarding this request, we get the result:

<img width="596" alt="{66FD2708-5D1F-4B49-A369-D5E970BA910F}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/815a16fb-b433-4ecf-9ec8-6c353f9bf513">

## dont-use-client-side
__Flag__:`picoCTF{no_clients_plz_b706c5}`

__Solution__: This is a pretty easy challenge, you go to the site and see that a password is required.

<img width="350" alt="{AF419262-AFB8-4DEE-96EA-20489D0911CE}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7dd28b9-2feb-4551-9df7-8bc52e9d279b">

Using `inspect element` to view the `html` code gives us nothing
so we view the javascript code of the website, `index.js` using the `Debugger` tab, where we can see a nested if-else statement for a particular password string, which of course, happens to be our flag.

<img width="365" alt="{58C718F1-0C0C-4EC6-BFC1-B93508FD29AC}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dcab0c8-145c-482b-9557-5e04f4b76e4b">

## where are the robots
__Flag__:`picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}`

__Solution__: Okay, so in this challenge, the site is displayed as:

<img width="241" alt="{B6E572AE-F54A-4B20-8982-FB688E05CCFA}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11afb775-bc22-43e9-9e1c-61ba5ec18306">

Since the name of the challenge mentions robots specifically, webcrawlers come to mind especially.
Websites usually have a page called `robots.txt` meant specifically for bots to visit first when crawling the web. This is done specifically to avoid overloading the website with requests.
Anyway, appending `robots.txt` to the url gives us:

<img width="190" alt="{01C36F1F-9F4B-4F69-999E-B2B14C031C80}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97be05f2-0f27-473d-81f9-d0bd47799ce3">

Disallow means the bot is not allowed to visit that URL, but we can, so setting the User Agent as `*` and going to the URL `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html` gives us:

<img width="267" alt="{8752F9E3-123F-42EF-B38B-745D3B7DF87A}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72c3b0b-8fc3-4dd4-b0be-e1972c35b7c6">

## SQL Direct
__Flag__:`picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_21c94904}`

__Solution__: Here, we get our first experience with SQL. For this challenge, we need to connect to a PostgreSQL server and find the flag.
Using the command `psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 60745 -U postgres pico` to connect to the database, we see this:
```
kerosene-picoctf@webshell:~$ psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 58949 -U postgres pico
Password for user postgres: 
psql (14.13 (Ubuntu 14.13-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 15.2 (Debian 15.2-1.pgdg110+1))
WARNING: psql major version 14, server major version 15.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.
```
Since this is a database, the flag is likely hidden in some table, so we use `\dt` for PostgreSQL to view all the tables which gives us:
```
pico=# \dt
         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner   
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)
```

Now, we need to view the contents of the `flags` table. So, we do that using the command `SELECT * FROM flags;`. 
Here, `*` is used to select all the columns (like file globbing) and display them.
