# Module 5: Practicing Piping
Piping is accomplished using the pipe symbol `|`. This symbol allows the output of one command to be used as the input for another command, facilitating a sequence of operations without the need for intermediate files.

The module teaches us about the three main channels in linux: `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`.
# Challenges
## Redirecting output
We can redirect the standard output using `>` character like so: `echo hi > another`

This will redirect the output of echo hi (which will be hi) to the file another. You can then use a program
such as `cat` to output this file. We can also append the output of multiple files to a single file using `>>`.
